# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

Dear Mentor,
I have completed the landing page project. I developed it based on The starter project with functions according to the project's requirements: adding class, id, data attributes to build dynamic html components (menus, buttons), processing events (click, scroll), perform interactive actions (like Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling).
I look forward to responding from you.
Yours faithfully

Buyn
